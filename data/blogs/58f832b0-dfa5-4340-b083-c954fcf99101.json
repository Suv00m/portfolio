  "description": "<p>earlier i used to write code using vscode (visual studio code), but there is lot of problem with that which i personally effecting me and im pretty much sure about that you might also faced similar situation, let's talk about my current pc spec <mark class=\"bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded\">11 th gen with 8gb of ram</mark> which is good but not if you use it for like half a decade or so. </p><p></p><p>so basically i have to get into something better, also the main reason is electron, which is based on chromium, and chromium is somehow feels cursed to get over with, the fact that every application gets bundled with chromium is sort of using tank for knitting (yeah it does not make sense right, lol). </p><p></p><p>also another part is i've recently converted from bloated windows 11 to arch with help of dhh and his omarchy (it's total different story we will get it later) </p><p>and in omarchy the default editor is lazyvim which is crazy right, so i begun with normal vscode and then cursor yeah ai is really booming, then after that the problem is i cannot open multiple chromium instances at same time for my multitasking requirements, yeah you have to, one can have only 24 hrs a day,  </p><p></p><p>and this whole situation make me switch to nvim, which is not so great at first then started using vim configuration and writing my own scripts and plugins using lua, which is started effecting me a bit, making me feel better, tough still use <mark class=\"bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded\">vim.opt.mouse = 'a'</mark> because i still need occasional mouse support for certain tasks, especially when navigating through complex file structures. </p><p></p><p>it's being a good start let's see how well it goes.</p><p></p><p></p>",
